<h1>CSC435: Homework 2</h1>
</center>
<hr />
<p>In Homework 2 you will design the architecture of your application, complete its internal logic, persist data directly to a db, and write a very simple presentation layer.</p>
<p>Use the MVC pattern to split the architecture of your application between logic, presentation, and dispatch. Write additional servlets as needed. Connect to the MySQL db to persist your data with simple SQL statements. Have your model communicate with a very simple presentation layer, built using JSPs.</p>
<p>Demo: I will want you to demonstrate that everything is deployed and working as it should. I will also want you to demonstrate compiling your sources by hand, and packaging your bytecode and configuration in a .war file by hand. Finally, I will want you to demonstrate being able to work with the AS from the command line. Basically, I'll want you to start with your sources and non-running AS and, without using an IDE, end up with a deployed working enterprise application.</p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your sources and your packaged application.</p>
